            Lie to your face about my mind
            So I see you with a smile
            I don't care about you
            Nor do I wish that you could've changed
            Not satisfied with you and me
            Love was all we really need
            Keep my love and honesty
            You'll never know the other me
            
            I'm dancing alone inside my head
            Somebody save me
            Do you know how I'm thinking now?
            I'm locked up in love
            I'll say the words you always made me
            Baby, you know what is going down
            
            Do you know the fight
            To keep you by my side?
            This love will never change
            But I just might go insane
            Do you know me now?
            So I can see a smile
            This love will never grow
            But at least you'll nеver know
            
            Used to keep my mind besidе the place you like
            Never wanted you to hear the words I sing inside
            I don't want to change the way we love right now
            Want you to be keeping up that smile tonight, every night</pre>
